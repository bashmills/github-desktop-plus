## **Fixes:**

- Repositories that belong to the same group in the repositories list are properly grouped together once again, instead of being split into multiple groups.

- Fixed Git worktrees not working in Windows.

- The "About" page and package information should now contain the correct GitHub Desktop Plus version number, instead of the upstream (GitHub Desktop) version.

- The "About" page now opens the correct release notes URL when the "release notes" link is clicked.
